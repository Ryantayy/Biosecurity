1,pest,Argentine stem weevil adult,Listronotus bonariensis,"Argentine stem weevil is common throughout New Zealand
Adults are small (2-3 mm long) and cryptically coloured making them difficult to see
Black elongated eggs are laid singularly or in groups of 2-4 in the leaf sheath of grasses
On hatching the white legless larvae tunnel into the grass stem where they usually remain until ready to pupate
Larvae pass through five stages increasing in size as they do. Larvae in the 5th stage may live outside of the plant particularly if the grass tillers are small
Pupation occurs in the litter layer.

They have an obvious ribbed texture on the shell.

They are found in freshwater or brackish water, sitting on top of sandy or muddy substrates or buried shallowly within them.","Argentine stem weevil (Listronotus bonariensis), an exotic weevil of South American origin, is ubiquitous in agricultural and amenity turf environments throughout the country. It used to be rated New Zealand’s worst insect pest of pasture.
With the sucessful introduction of a biocontrol agent and development of endophyte infected ryegrasses, Argentine stem weevil, although still a major pest, no longer has the impact it once had.
The adults feed on a range of grasses but it is the larvae which develop and feed, predominantly, within the tillers of several agriculturally important grasses that are the main pest stage. These weevils are a major pest of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in developed pastures, maize and cereal crops. Uncontrolled they have been estimated to cost the country up to $280m per annum.
The adult weevil is a hard bodied compact beetle usually less than 3.5 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. It is grey-brown with three pale longitudinal stripes on its thorax. Its colour, small size and the fact that soil particles adhere to its body make adult weevils very difficult to detect by eye.
Although it can be active during daylight, night is when it usually feeds on the leaf blades and lay its eggs. Adult weevils commence egg laying in spring as soon as temperatures allow (average daily temp 10°C).
Eggs are laid in the sheaths of grass tillers. After hatching the white legless larvae tunnel and feed within tillers. Large larvae may live outside the tillers and within the plant crown especially if the tillers are small. Each larvae may destroy up to eight ryegrass tillers during development to adult and are capable of moving to new plants when required. The larvae pass through five stages of development before leaving the plants and pupating in soil.
New adults commence laying eggs almost immediately after emergence from pupae giving rise to a new generation but egg laying is controlled by day-length and stops in Mid-March.
The number of generations Argentine stem weevil can achieve in a year is driven by temperature. Pest status is reached when two or more generations occur as happens from Canterbury northwards. In Otago and Southland historically only one generation has generally occurred each year but anecdotal evidence suggests this has changed and stem weevil may be increasing in significance.
The adult weevils can fly and mass dispersal flights can take place on calm, sunny days in summer and autumn.
Host plants
Grasses, especially Italian and endophyte-free perennial ryegrasses, seedling maize and cereals, are the main hosts. Adults have been reported feeding on germinating brassica crops but may easily be mistaken for native weevils which commonly do this","Adult feeding is characterised by “windowing” of the grass leaf near its tip. Windows are typically rectangular and appear as clear areas, the pane being the lower leaf cuticle which is left intact. Veins encountered while the adults feed are cut at the base and displaced. They appear as pigtail-like threads attached at the upper edge of the window.
Adult feeding damage is not normally significant except in summer-sown pasture. Larvae mining the stem do the greatest damage to vegetative tillers, which wilt and yellow from the centre outwards. Damaged tillers contain larval frass and may show small, circular exit holes near the base. Flowering tillers when attacked whiten and may snap off owing to mechanical weakening. Where infestation is heavy, severe damage is done to the sward, particularly in dry conditions when pasture growth is retarded.
The presence of an endophytic fungus in perennial ryegrass makes it less susceptible to Argentine stem weevil attack. Endophytes do not occur in annual ryegrasses.
Other pasture grasses, cereals and maize are are also affected by argentine stem weevil. They are often reported feeding on other plants e.g. brassica seedlings. In such instances this may be driven by shortage of grasses for food or the weevils may be seeking moisture.
Several species of native weevils that appear superficially similar to Argentine stem weevil are common in some pastures and crops and these are easily mistaken for Argentine stem weevil. It is quite likely that most damage to non-grass crops attributed to stem weevil is due to native weevil feeding.","Insecticide
Argentine stem weevil is difficult to control with insecticides. Several products are available that will kill adult weevils but pastures can be rapidly re-infested from others nearby. The larvae generally live within the plants on which they feed and are therefore protected from most insecticides.
When establishing new pastures there are some options that can mitigate damage from this pest. Cultivation can destroy larval weevil populations and allow re-establishment of grasses into a clean pasture. This however will not protect against adults which may survive cultivation or re-invade the paddock. An insecticide can be used if necessary in this situation. Foliar sprays, prills drilled with the seed and seed coatings are available.
If very high numbers of adults are present insecticide seed coating may not offer sufficient protection to avoid loss of seedlings. Even endophyte infected seedlings (see below) are vulnerable to attack while establishing.
If direct-drilling is used to re-establish pastures larvae are able to survive in dying vegetation and migrate to new plants after sowing. As with all insect pests assessing the probability of damage will assist in choosing a control option.
Biocontrol
A small wasp, Microctonus hyperodae, was introduced to New Zealand in 1990 as a biological control agent and was released throughout the country. It is now well established in most areas and in combination with endophyte infected ryegrasses has reduced the impact this weevil formerly had on New Zealand pastures. This wasp is a parasite and lays its eggs inside the adult weevil. This sterilises and eventually kills the weevil.
Endophyte is a term used to describe an organism that lives inside another. In this case the endophyte is a fungus called Neotyphodium lolii that lives within perennial ryegrass plants.
Toxins produced by this fungus protect the plant from grazing. The “wild type” endophyte that can occur naturally in ryegrass, and used to be common in pasture cultivars, protected the plants from argentine stem weevil but was also responsible for stock health problems such as heat stress and ryegrass staggers.
Plant breeders have been able to selectively improve the fungus and ryegrass cultivars are now available with a choice of endophyte. The most prominent of these is called AR1, but NEA2 in Trojan and AR37 are also effective. These forms of the endophyte protect ryegrass from argentine stem weevil but eliminate or reduce the effects on stock caused by the standard endophyte. When selecting perennial ryegrass cultivars for pastures, one of these endophytes should generally be used and form the backbone of argentine stem weevil management. AR37 and NEA2 in Trojan will also protect against other insect pests.",argentine-stem-weevil-web.jpg,Argentine-stem-weevil-adult-2.jpg
2,pest,Black field cricket,Teleogryllus commodus,"Black crickets are found throughout the North Island and milder coastal regions of the South Island
Usually they are only economically important in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu
They are often confused with several species of much smaller native crickets.","Adult black field crickets are about 2.5 cm long and are actually dark brown. They have large heads with very long antennae. They have wings and although they generally do not fly there are occasional mass flights when numbers are high. Females have a long ovipositor (egg-laying tube) which extends past and under the wings. The adult males “chirp”, by rubbing their wings together
There is just one generation a year but the life stages overlap. Eggs, which are white, ovoid-shaped, and about 0.3 cm long are laid singly, but loosely clustered, about 1 cm deep in damp soil. A single female cricket is capable of laying up to 2000 eggs between mid-February and early May. After hatching the nymphs take 2-4 months to mature into adults and then live for 2-3 months. The nymphs pass through 9-10 stages and resemble small adults but do not have wings, or in the case of females, ovipositors, until the 8th and 9th stages. Overwintering occurs as eggs. The smaller nymphs live and hide within pasture and this makes them difficult to detect. Larger nymphs and adults tend to shelter in cracks in soil or under cow pats and litter
Although found throughout the North Island and milder coastal regions of the South Island they are usually only economically important in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu. Black field crickets, especially the nymphs, are often confused with several species of much smaller native crickets. These only grow to about 1 cm and crickets larger than this are likely to be black field crickets. Native crickets are also active during the day and when disturbed will jump and be easily seen. In contrast black field crickets are active at night and if disturbed during the day will run for shelter and remain hidden. When threatened they will jump quickly away. Black field crickets can also be identified by a distinctive white band around their middle.","Black field crickets are generally pests only in northern areas of New Zealand. Their significance is increased in long dry periods and in soils that crack in during these periods. They feed most commonly on the leaves and germinating seeds of grasses, especially ryegrasses, but also eat legumes and weeds
Their feeding, and the type of damage they cause, can be categorised into three types:
Grazing, where adults and the larger nymphs compete with stock for food. Over one hectare 2 crickets/m2 will consume the equivalent of one sheep. In plague seasons as many as 20-40 crickets/m2 frequently occur and can cause losses of 30kg DM/ha/day. In dairy pasture an average density of 25 crickets/m2 can be responsible for 2000 kg DM/ha/yr lost production
During long dry periods the growing crowns of grasses are attacked often killing the plants and leaving the soil open to weed invasion
Sown, or self sown seedlings, may be destroyed by cricket feeding.
The potential for long term pasture damage and unseen losses makes early detection of crickets important. In areas prone to cricket damage the density can be quickly assessed by pouring a weak detergent solution (4 mls dishwashing liquid in 10 L water) over a known area of pasture. This will “flush” crickets out of cracks in the soil and make it easy to count them and determine their density. A density of 10/m2 is considered economically damaging.","Chemical control
Populations of more than 10 crickets/m2 are economically damaging. Control of black field crickets is usually by using grain baits coated with an insecticide (maldison). For more information consult the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual or an agrichemical company representative.",Black-field-cricket.jpg,Black-field-cricket2.jpg
3,pest,Clover Root Weevil,Sitona obsoletus,"Major pest of clovers, both red and white cultivars but white clover often most severely attacked
Found throughout New Zealand
Adults feed on clover foliage leaving distinctive notches on leaf margins
Larvae are most the damaging stage destroying clover roots and root nodules
Infested pastures become clover deficient.
Biological control has significantly reduced impact of this pest","Clover root weevil (CRW) adults are mahogany-brown, 4-6 mm long, with a short, blunt nose. It can be difficult to tell adult CRW apart from other weevils that can also be found in pasture. Adult weevils are most abundant in autumn and spring. They lay their eggs on the pasture surface and when these hatch the larvae move into the soil seeking food and shelter. These are legless, creamy white grubs, 1-6 mm long with a brown head. They may be found by digging into the root zone under clover plants. Larvae are present throughout the year but are more abundant in late spring and late autumn. The larvae are generally much smaller than grass-grub larvae, which can be common in pastures, and they lack the distinctive C-shape that characterise grass grub
Clover root weevil has been present in New Zealand since at least 1994 but was not discovered until 1996. By 2006 it was present throughout the North Island and by 2015 throughout the South Island. The combination of a favourable environment, lack of competition for an abundant food resource, high reproductive capability of the weevil and a lack of natural enemies inevitably meant clover root weevil was going to become one of New Zealand\’s most damaging pests of clover.
There are two generations a year with adult populations peaking in early and late summer in the North Island and summer and autumn in the South Island. The adults can live for several months with the females laying up to several hundred eggs. Young larvae mainly feed on clover root nodules. As they mature they move onto the roots and stolons. Adults feed on clover leaves producing characteristic notching of leaf margins. Dispersal by flight occurs during the summer and autumn with the proportion of adults having flight or reproductive capability dependent on prevailing climatic and pasture conditions
While clover is abundant and summer rainfall high or irrigation used most weevils remain reproductive and stay in the pastures they lived in as larvae. When there is drought and clover is limited a large proportion of weevils stop being reproductive and instead develop flight muscles and disperse to new locations. Once they have located a suitable site the flight muscles atrophy and the weevils again become reproductive. Clover root weevil is a very proficient hitch-hiker in hay and on vehicles.","Feeding by adult CRW causes distinctive semi-circular notching on the edges of clover leaves. These notches are symmetrical and uniform, unlike the jagged or irregular damage caused by other pasture pests, such as slugs and caterpillars. While this damage can appear serious, generally, it does not cause significant damage in established pastures. Adult feeding can however, kill large numbers of clover seedlings in newly sown pasture
Although adult feeding damage is most noticeable, feeding by larvae is more damaging. The young larvae feed on root nodules and later the roots. This reduces the plant’s ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and reduces plant growth. A reduction in nitrogen fixed also impacts on the growth of other pasture plants and leads to an increased requirement for nitrogen fertiliser to be applied. Prior to the release of the biocontrol agent moderate populations of larvae (approx. 300/m2) have reduced clover production by 35% (1000kg DM/ha) annually with greatest losses occurring in spring. Without additional nitrogen it has been estimated a typical Waikato dairy farm would suffer a 16% reduction in net profit. An extra 180 kg N/ha was required on some farms to alleviate the impact of the weevil. During invasive periods larval numbers as high as 1800/m2 have been recorded. With the establishment of biological control numbers are now usually much less. Left unchecked MPI estimated clover root weevil could have cost New Zealand between $200m and $1b per annum.
A cost: benefit analysis undertaken in 2015, has shown that for Southland alone the impact of the parasitoid wasp in supressing CRW was worth $2.3m pa for beef and lamb farms and $7 M pa for dairy farms","Insecticides
During pasture establishment application of a foliar insecticide can be used close to seedling emergence to control adults and provide a window in which clover plants may establish before re-invasion by the weevil occurs. Seed coatings do not provide adequate protection against this pest and should not be relied on
Clover root weevil is difficult to control with insecticides in established pastures. Because the larvae live in the soil and are relatively immobile, and because New Zealand soils are high in organic matter which binds up insecticide, getting an insecticide to them is difficult to achieve. The adults are very mobile and although they can be killed, pastures are rapidly reinvaded from surrounding areas.
Insecticides are harmful to the biocontrol agent
Clover and pasture management
Clover root weevil is dependent on clover for its survival. When pastures are severely damaged destroying the remaining clover with a selective herbicide and/or cultivation followed by a farrow period leaving the pasture clover free for 6-8 months can cause the weevil population to die off and provide a clean pasture in which clover can be re-established. Drilling clover seed into a damaged pasture without removing the older clover plants should not be attempted as the weevils prefer seedlings and will concentrate their feeding on them. Biological control will not prevent seedling damage.
Establishment of clover seedlings at sowing can be improved by utilising break crops rather than straight pasture to pasture rotations. A brassica or an all grass break crop will provide a clean paddock to which clover can be re-introduced. Clover management to maintain healthy plants is important. A healthy plant can tolerate more feeding pressure than an unhealthy plant. Adequate fertiliser should be used to keep clover growing in the presence of the weevil and to keep other pasture plants, which would normally benefit from clover nitrogen fixation, healthy as well. When clover is put under pressure by clover root weevil not only do the larvae consume nodules but the plants respond to the stress by reducing nodule production. In such instances compensatory nitrogen should be applied frequently to infested pastures in small amounts. Clover should not be put under stress by other factors, do not overgraze and avoid pugging of soil over winter.
A parasitoid wasp for biological control
In 2006 AgResearch introduced a small parasitic wasp (Microctonus aethiopoides) as a biological control agent against clover root weevil. This wasp was released at numerous locations in both islands and is now very widely distributed. This biocontrol agent will not eliminate clover root weevil or the damage it causes, but it has reduced the impact of the weevil and in most locations the impact of the weevil has been negated by the biocontrol agent. However, there will always be some years and some areas where the biocontrol agent temporarily losses effectiveness either because of climatic events, use of insecticides that kill the wasp or pasture renewal events. Biological control will re-establish.",Clover-root-weevil-adult.jpg,Adult-clover-root-weevil.jpg
4,pest,Diamondback moth,Plutella xylostella,"Pest of all brassica crops
Found throughout New Zealand
Moths are small – around 10 mm long
Moths have diamond shaped patterns on their wings while at rest
Caterpillars feed on underside of leaves
Colour varies from yellowish green to grey green.","Diamondback moth is common throughout the country and is a common pest of brassicas
The adult moths are small slender insects with a wingspan of about 10 mm. At rest the wings are held above the body and a line of yellowish diamond shaped markings become apparent hence the name
The moths are primarily nocturnal
Diamondback moth development is driven largely by temperature and one life cycle may be as quick as 12 days or as long as 126
Females lay their 0.5 mm eggs on the underside of brassica leaves singularly or in groups of up to 20. The moths live for about 14 days and each female is capable of producing up to 450 eggs
In summer these eggs usually hatch in 12 days but it can be as short as three days or in winter as long as 40
In warm weather the caterpillars take about 14-17 days to pass through five larval stages and grow to their final size of 10 mm long
They pupate on the underside of leaves in characteristic loosely woven cocoons remaining as pupae for 2-3 weeks
In warmer areas of the country there may be 6-7 generations per year.","Diamondback moth caterpillars feed on all brassica crops
When the larvae hatch from the egg they burrow into the leaf and feed on tissue within
As they grow they emerge to feed on the lower leaf surface leaving the upper surface intact. This distinguishes their feeding from that of cabbage white butterfly caterpillars
They often cause damage to crops and scouting the crop will allow detection of caterpillars while they are small and allow treatment before damage reaches a high level.","Two insect biological control agents, the wasps Diadegma semiclausum and Diadromus collaris, and a fungus, Entomophthora spaerosperma, usually exert a high level of control of caterpillars in the North Island but are considered less effective in the South Island
Damage by diamondback moth caterpillars often appears in combination with that of cabbage white butterfly caterpillars. Either on its own or in combination with the latter application of an insecticide can be worthwhile. Several insecticides are registered for use against diamondback moth caterpillars in forage brassica crops. These should be applied as early as possible to prevent damage becoming extensive.

5,pest,Greasy cutworm,Agrotis ipsilon,"Found throughout agricultural areas of New Zealand.
Has a very wide host range including many vegetables, maize, sweetcorn, cereals, grasses, lucerne, white clover, plantain, and weeds such as docks.
Although generally considered a minor pest, it can be a serious problem in kumara and seedling maize and sweetcorn field crops.
The moths are nocturnal and attracted to lights. They are dark mottled brown to greyish-brown, with females darker than males. At rest they have a rectangular shape and are 35- 50 mm long.
Eggs are laid singly or in clusters on vegetation, plant debris or into cracks in the ground, with low, dense vegetation (e.g. broadleaved weeds) being preferred.
Small caterpillars are reddish brown to greyish green and are usually found on plant foliage.
Larger caterpillars live in burrows up to 8 cm deep in the soil. They are typically greyish-green with two yellowish longitudinal stripes down the body. Their skin has a shiny greasy appearance.","Moths can be found year round but are most common from October to April. Most greasy cutworm overwinter as larvae and pupae. Caterpillars can also be found throughout the year but growth and development only occur when temperatures exceed 10.4oC.
Each female moth lays around 600-800 eggs which initially are whitish-yellow but turn brown within 24 hours and become darker as hatching approaches. In summer they hatch in 3-7 days.
 After hatching young caterpillars forage on leaves until they are about one third grown. Larger caterpillars lie curled up 25-50mm below the soil surface during the day and emerge at night to feed. They often store parts of severed plants underground allowing them to remain underground for several days during unfavourable weather.
The caterpillars can grow up to 50 mm long. When fully grown they form earthen cells in the top 50 mm of soil and pupate. Pupae are 17-25 mm long and reddish-brown appearing almost black just before the moth emerges.
The normal summer life cycle takes from 7 to 12 weeks but varies in length depending on location and climate. There are 2-3 generations per year.","The larger caterpillars are the most damaging stage, cutting seedlings off at their base or tunnelling in the stems.
Maize plants cut above the growing point usually survive but have greatly reduced yields.
Losses of well over 10,000 plants/ha can occur at populations of 3 caterpillars/100 plants before the two leaf stage or 6 caterpillars/100 plants at the two to four leaf stage.
Brassica seedlings and fodder beet seedlings can also be cut at ground level and killed. Feeding to cotyledons and leaves may slow plant growth.
During windy periods eggs are usually laid on the leeward side of shelter (trees, hedges etc) resulting in damage often being worst in these areas.","Thorough cultivation and good weed control, to eliminate alternative hosts (e.g. docks and plantains), before planting will reduce cutworm numbers.
Sowing treated seed controls cutworms during seedling establishment, and also controls black beetle and stem weevil.
Scout maize and sweetcorn paddocks regularly after maize emergence until the 4-leaf stage particularly on the leeward side of shelter. Where plants have been recently felled, scratching carefully in the soil around the cut plant base will usually reveal the curled up caterpillars. Their size will give an indication of future crop damage. Very large larvae about 50 mm long will be close to pupation and further feeding may be limited. Smaller larvae will feed for longer and continue to cause plant damage.
A range of insecticides have registration for use against cutworm in maize. Synthetic pyrethroids are generally the most cost effective. In fields where cutworms are a perennial problem, an insecticide can be used in combination with pre-emergence herbicides to reduce cutworm numbers.

6,pest,Plantain moth,Scopula rubraria and Epyaxa rosearia,"Consists of at least 2 species which may be difficult to tell apart
Widespread native insects, occasionally reaching pest levels
Feed on a range of plants including plantain
Their recent appearance in large numbers in plantain crops has given rise to the name Plantain moth. It belongs to a group of moths commonly called carpet moths
Moths are small, less than 20 mm wide, light brown with darker spots and a distinct darker brown band towards the end on the wings. Darker band more pronounced on E. rosearia while S. rubriaria has a more spotted pattern.
Moths will fly up from the crop in front of people stock or vehicles, sometimes in very large numbers
Caterpillars of S. rubraria are brown but vary greatly in tone and pattern. E. rosearia caterpillars may be green or brown. Both are less than 20 mm long
Caterpillars are loopers, they raise part of their body off the ground or plant when moving.","Very little is known about the biology of these insects
They are native moths/caterpillars, of a type commonly called loopers, found throughout New Zealand and also Australia
They are widespread in New Zealand occasionally reaching very high levels in plantain crops
They have short generation times and several generations per year occur
It is likely that development is temperature driven and that it is favoured by warm weather
They are most abundant in late summer and largely disappears from crops in autumn
They probably feed on a wide range of plants but are usually associated with plantain species and  appear to find “Tonic” plantain to their liking having been observed causing noticeable, sometimes very severe, damage to crops.","The caterpillars feed on the plant leaves causing small holes which can join up and in severe cases leave only leaf veins
Generally little plant damage is attributed to this insect but it is very commonly found in plantain stands and damage to “Tonic” plantain is frequently reported
Normally the growth of plantain is so great that feeding by these caterpillars has very little impact on plant production
Occasionally however, severe damage is reported as a consequence of very high caterpillar numbers and may be concentrated in some paddocks while others close by are unaffected
Why, and how, this situation arises is currently unknown but is under investigation
Crop health, plant stress and growing conditions may have a significant role to play in the severity of damage observed.","There are no registered insecticides for control of plantain moth caterpillars but broad spectrum insecticides with good activity against other caterpillars may also provide control of plantain moth. It would be wise to consult with agrichemical professionals before using these insecticides for off label use
Too little is currently known about this insect for management options that may affect build-up of caterpillars to be suggested. When its biology is better known some options may present themselves
As a general guide a healthy crop will tolerate more insect damage than an unhealthy one.",Epyaxa-rosearia2_James.jpg,Plantain-moth-on-Moth-on-Tonic-plantain.jpeg
7,pest,Porina,"Moths fly in large numbers during spring and early summer. They do not feed.
Each moth can lay up to 3000 eggs which are scattered over the pasture surface
Most eggs and very young caterpillars do not survive
Caterpillars initially live in silk tunnels on soil surface and construct burrows, up to 30 cm deep, as they grow larger from which they emerge at night to feed
On average the caterpillars each moult 7-8 times
Caterpillars and the damage they cause are most noticable from April until September
Caterpillars appear dirty white with grey back and a deep brown head. When handled they will regurgitate a dark brown substance.",,"Porina are a complex of caterpillars occuring throughout New Zealand but damaging populations are uncommon in the northern half of the North Island. The moths fly in spring, summer, and early autumn depending on location and species present. The moths don’t feed and live only a few days. During these flights female moths may lay up to 3000 eggs scattered over the surface of pasture or grassy areas. The eggs hatch in 10 to 21 days and the young caterpillars construct silk lined casings on the soil surface. As the caterpillars grow they construct permanent burrows in the soil which eventually reach a depth of about 250 mm. They emerge from their burrows at night to feed, severing grass and clover leaves at the base of plants and dragging these back to their burrows where they are eaten. The caterpillars are reluctant to venture far from their burrows and pasture damage initially appears as 5 to 6 cm in diameter bare areas around burrows. As food is depleted they move further from their burrows and if sufficient caterpillars are present large areas of pasture are damaged or destroyed. Development from egg to adult takes 12 months. For those species studied, eight to nine instars (stages between moults) appears to be usual.
There are seven porina species (Wiseana cervinata, W.copularis, W. fuliginea, W. jocosa, W. mimica, W. umbraculata and W. signata), 3 of which comprise 2 sub species each, and they are difficult to distinguish from each other. Although traditionally porina have been viewed as a species complex that can be treated as one species, this is no longer considered a valid approach. For pest management purposes it is important for a farmer to know whether spring , summer or autumn flying species predominate on their property.
The distributions of the species overlap and as many as four species have been recorded co-existing in pasture. Although, with experience, moths can be visually identified to species the caterpillars cannot and DNA technology must be used. Based on adult flights W. cervinata and W. copularis are traditionally thought to be the major pest species and molecular identification of caterpillars suggests W. copularis (which has early and late flying sub species) to be the most widespread and probably the more significant of the two. It is likely that most species could cause local or occasional damage but W. signata and W. umbraculata appear uncommon in improved pasture. The most significant difference between species from a pest point of view is the timing of moth flights and therefore the timing of caterpillar development. W. cervinata moths emerge and lay eggs in spring and are seldom seen after December. W. copularis moths may also be present in spring but their main emergence in the South Island is in January and in the central and lower North Island in late February early March. In Westland autumn flights of W. copularis also occur and there is some evidence that, currently minor, autumn flights may also occur in the southern South Island. Several months can separate the main flights in any one area. This means that the development of caterpillars of early flying moths may be three months ahead of caterpillers from late flying moths. While this will have minimal effect on the effectiveness of organophosphate insecticides it is an important consideration when applying diflubenzuron which is most effective against early larval stages.
Natural population regulation
Porina occur in most pastures most of the time. Whether or not they attain pest status is largely governed by weather over the time eggs hatch and while young larvae are living on the surface, and natural occurrence of diseases. Porina are prone to several diseases which can only persist if porina are present. Porina outbreaks, and therefore damage to pastures, usually occur when the porina/disease association is disrupted. Disruption occurs when porina numbers are too low to enable disease organisms to persist. Commonly this is a result of cultivation but may also be due to drought, occasionally insecticide use and in high rainfall areas, such as Westland, very high soil moisture. Multiple dry or wet years may exacerbate later damage. In the years following disruption, porina populations increase and cause pasture damage, before disease organisms build up enough to reduce porina numbers to below damaging levels. The outbreak most often occurs 2-3 years after the disruption so damage to young pastures, established using cultivation, typically occurs in their second and third winter although 1 and 4 year old pastures may also be hit. Pasture renovation by direct drilling favours retention of porina diseases in the soil reducing likelihood of damage. When the porina outbreaks are the result of drought, pastures of any age can be affected.","Porina are grazers. At low densities they are direct competitors with stock for food and reduce the amount of foliage available. At higher densities plants are destroyed allowing inferior plant species to establish reducing long term pasture quality and production.
Depending on pasture productivity:
25 – 50 porina/m2 (1-2 per 8 inch spade square) equate to grazing 1 ewe/ha. Plants are seldom destroyed at this level but production losses may occur
50 – 75 porina/m2 (2-3 per spade) will destroy some plants, open up pasture and allow weed species to establish. Pasture production will be reduced
100 or more porina/m2 (4 or more per spade) will result in major pasture damage. Pasture plants will be destroyed, bare areas in pasture will develop and weed species may establish. The amount of pasture produced and the quality of that pasture will be reduced.
Pastures at risk
Awareness and early recognition of damage will avoid severe pasture loss and prolong pasture life. The earlier control measures are implemented the greater the economic return. Often the presence of caterpillars from early moth flights is not noticed until May onwards, and from autumn flights as late as July, by which time, in both cases, considerable damage has occurred
Porina are present in most pastures – but not always at damaging levels
Porina numbers are largely governed by summer weather and association with diseases
Outbreaks and damage occur when the porina/disease association is disrupted
This can result from cultivation, hot dry summers occasionally insecticide use and very high soil moisture
Damage often occurs 1-4 years after cultivation but most often in 2nd or 3rd winter
In porina prone areas, 2-3 year old pastures are at particular risk of attack
After drought, or very wet years, pastures of any age can be affected and damage may be widespread. Damage often shows 1-3 years after drought
Long or dense pasture in summer favours egg and young caterpillar survival, this makes young pastures used for hay production vulnerable
May be multiple main flights of porina

In porina prone areas monitor young pastures for porina and assess porina numbers as early as possible. Timing of assessments will depend on whether spring, summer orautumn flying species are predominant. Some options are:

If spring flying species are mainly present:
Summer/ Early Autumn

Caterpillars are small (less than 25 mm), live on the soil surface or in small burrows and are very difficult to find
Take turves 200 x 200 mm (standard spade spits) x 30 mm deep at least 10 per pasture, invert under a heat source over a container of water overnight, porina will drop into the water where they can be counted and may be very small.
Early / Mid Autumn

Dig and hand sort soil, ten spade spits per paddock
Use insecticide to indicate pasture loss – Apply insecticide to a strip (2 x 20 m) of pasture where it can be easily seen. If strip appears greener than surrounding pasture after 3-4 weeks a pest is causing damage. Dig and sort soil to determine if that pest is porina.
Autumn onwards

Dig and hand sort soil, up to ten spade spits per paddock (if high numbers are present less will do).
Where January species occur:
Early-Mid Autumn

A mixture of sizes from early and late flying moths may be present
Sample as for small caterpillars above.
Mid Autumn

Dig and hand sort soil, large larvae will be causing damage
Small larvae found in late autumn and early winter may cause damage into the spring and early summer but this can be hidden by increased pasture growth at this time
Densities greater than 2 per spade square (50/m2) will cause damage (see Impact).
Where February/March flying species occur:
(lower and central North Island, Westland)

Late Autumn

A mixture of sizes from early and late flying moths may be present
Sample as for small caterpillars above.
Early Winter

Dig and hand sort soil, large larvae will be causing damage
Small larvae found in late autumn and early winter may cause damage into the spring and early summer but this can be hidden by increased pasture growth at this time
Densities greater than 2 per spade square (50/m2) will cause damage (see Impact).
Chemical Control
Treat pastures as soon as sampling indicates a damaging porina population is present or damage is noticed Registered chemicals for porina control are:

Active ingredient	Action	When to apply
Diazinon	Contact and ingestion	Any time caterpillars are present
Chlorpyrifos	Contact, fumigant and ingestion	Any time caterpillars are present
Diflubenzuron	Must be ingested, no contact activity. Disrupts caterpillar moulting.	Must be applied when caterpillars are small, 8 – 10 weeks after moth flights
Consult your farm consultant, industry representative or the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual for more information about chemical control.

Biological control
There is currently no biological control option for porina.

Management
Survival of porina eggs and young larvae are reduced by dry conditions
Dry hot summers can keep numbers low – Heavy stocking and close grazing in summer can reduce survival
Porina are favoured by mild wet summers and long or dense pasture cover – young pastures shut up for hay often affected
Cultivation predisposes pastures to damage 2-3 years later
Direct drilling retains porina diseases in soil reducing likelihood of damage
AR37 ryegrasses, cocksfoot and tall fescue are not palatable to porina – feeding may focus on clovers growing with these grasses.",Porina-Small-1-web.jpg,Porina-Large-1-web.jpeg
8,pest,Redheaded pasture cockchafer,Adoryphorus coulonii,"Redheaded pasture cockchafer is currently restricted to pastures in some areas on the Port Hills and Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, and also to amenity turf within Christchurch city
This insect has a two-year lifecycle so serious damage may only occur once every two years
The very large larvae (up to 30 mm long) of this pest can cause serious pasture damage during autumn and winter
Adult beetles are not known to cause any damage","The redheaded pasture cockchafer is an Australian species but has been present in Canterbury on the Port Hills and Banks Peninsula since the early 1960s. Only limited spread from the known infested areas has been observed to date. However, it is at serious pasture pest in Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and parts of New South Wales and is possible it will eventually spread to pastures with similar characteristics in many areas of New Zealand
Adults are shiny dark brown/black robust looking beetles very similar in appearance to the African black beetle found in parts of the North Island. Both sexes are approximately 12 mm long and can be found close to the soil surface in pasture through early spring. The beetles undertake dispersal flights during warm evenings from September to mid-October. Eggs, about 2 mm long and ovoid to spherical in shape, are laid singly in soil 10 – 50mm deep in mid to late spring
The larvae pass through 3 stages during their first year before pupating and becoming beetles during the second summer of their two-year lifecycle. Beetles emerge from these pupae and spend the following autumn and winter deep in the soil before surfacing again as adult beetles in spring
The C shaped larvae appear superficially like common grass-grub but have a red head capsule and when full size, are up to four times the size and weight of a common grass grub","Red headed pasture cockchafer larvae feed on organic matter and live root material present in the top 100 mm of soil.
Pasture damage is caused by large 3rd stage larvae feeding on plant roots in autumn and winter. If large numbers of larvae are present pasture root systems can be completely severed about 2.5 cm below the soil surface and the pasture can be rolled up like a carpet. If lower numbers are present pasture damage similar to that caused by the New Zealand grass grub can appear with patches of dead pasture becoming visible and pulled plants seen post grazing.
Shallow-rooted pasture plants are reported to be at most risk from cockchafer damage.
The damage threshold for redheaded pasture cockchafer larvae, reported in Australian literature, is about 70/m2 which is considerably lower than for the New Zealand grass-grub.
Beetles do not appear to feed so do not cause any damage.","There are few options available to control the Australian redheaded pasture cockchafer.
No chemicals are registered in New Zealand for control of larvae or adults in established pasture or for pasture seedling establishment.
Off target use of insecticides registered for use against the common grass grub have been attempted with variable results. This pest prefers soils with high organic matter which may bind to insecticides and reduce their efficiency.
Redheaded pasture cockchafer larvae are not known to be affected by any currently available grass endophytes. The adult beetle does not feed so is unlikely to be directly affected by endophytes.
A biological control product based on a strain of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae was developed and used in Australia in the 1990s but has since been removed from the market due to production problems.
Reports from Australia suggest vigorous top-working, such as using a rototiller, greatly reduces damage to resown pastures.
As this pest has a two-year lifecycle there may be a damaging population present in an area only each second year. Monitoring populations by spade sampling may allow a farmer to identify years in which new pastures could be established in the absence of potentially damaging populations.",Redheaded-pasture-cockchafer-beetles-1.jpg,Redheaded-pasture-cockchafer-beetles-2.jpg
9,pest,Sod webworm,Eudonia sabulosella,"Sod webworms are caterpillars of several native moth species
Eudonia sabulosella is the only economically important species in pasture
Resemble small porina caterpillars
Feed on a wide range of grasses
Occasionally cause damage to pastures in the northern North Island
Can be a significant pest in sports turf throughout the country
Widely distributed throughout New Zealand","There are numerous species of caterpillars grouped under the common name sod webworm. Most are probably insignificant as pests.
The main species to which damage has been attributed is Eudonia sabulosella and in agricultural environments pasture damage has only been recorded from the northern North Island. The moths of this species fly from late October to February with largest numbers seen early summer. Eggs are laid from mid-November to early February and these are found just below ground level attached to grass or moss stems. E. sabulosella caterpillars are present throughout the year but are more easily seen during winter when they attain their greatest size. They seldom exceed 2 cm in length. Pupation occurs from late September. There is one generation per year.
Eggs of other species are scattered over the soil surface or deposited in flight and some may have two or more generations per year. The flight periods of moths of most species are longer in warmer areas compared to cooler regions. Light rain appears to stimulate egg laying and moth activity.
Caterpillars start their lives where the eggs hatch constructing tunnels using silk to which fine soil particles and pieces of vegetation are attached. Usually these tunnels are on the soil surface attached to plant stems and generally not deeper than 25 mm but occasionally caterpillars can be found as deep as 40 mm in the soil. Pupation occurs in the soil.
Caterpillars are considered moss feeders but they readily take a wide range of grasses, white and red clovers. Caterpillars feed at night and similar to porina the larger caterpillars cut whole blades of grass or other plants at the plant base and take these back to their tunnels. Also, as with porina, this feeding results in bare areas of ground that can be invaded by weeds.
Large sod webworm caterpillars superficially resemble small porina, reinforced by both living in tunnels, and this often leads to confusion with identification. The easiest way to tell the two pests apart to examine their heads. With porina the head is solid mahogany brown with no patternation. With sod webworm the head is a light brown with darker markings.
The moths of several species have been observed feeding on flowers of red and white clover, dandelion and manuka.","Ryegrass, timothy, white clover and red clover are readily eaten by sod webworm caterpillars as are less valuable plants such as browntop, paspalum, prairie grass, sweet vernal and Yorkshire fog.
Sod webworm only occasionally cause damage to pasture. When caterpillars are numerous enough their feeding and damage resembles that of porina. Like porina they are grazers and can over-graze, and kill, plants in the vicinity of their tunnels. When this happens weed species can invade those areas and cause a reduction in pasture quality.
In fine sports turfs they can be a more significant issue as damage is much less tolerable in golf greens and bowling greens.","Ryegrass, timothy, white clover and red clover are readily eaten by sod webworm caterpillars as are less valuable plants such as browntop, paspalum, prairie grass, sweet vernal and Yorkshire fog.

10,pest,"White butterfly, cabbage white butterfly",Pieris rapae,"Butterflies are white with one or two black spots on their wings
Caterpillars are green with a narrow orange strip down their backs
Caterpillars may reach 25 mm long
Found throughout New Zealand
Caterpillars feed on all brassica types
Severe feeding leaves only leaf viens.","The white butterfly is common throughout the country and is a common pest of brassicas
Adult butterflies have creamy white wings with the tips of the forewings tipped with grey or black
Females have two black spots on each forewing while males have only one. Both have a single black spot on each hind wing
The average wingspan is about 50 mm
Butterflies are commonly seen flying above brassica crops or feeding on the nectar of flowers
The females lay yellow oval eggs singularly on the underside of brassica leaves
Each female can produce up to 400 eggs. In warm weather these hatch in 8-10 days giving rise to 1.5 mm long yellow/green caterpillars. As these grow they become a dull green colour with an orange strip down their backs
There are five caterpillar stages and eventually they reach about 25 mm long. They pupate off the host plant on fence posts, nearby shrubs or buildings
It takes 20-40 days from egg to pupa and a further 15-18 days to emerge as a new adult
Depending on temperature there can be three or four generations a year
They spend the winter as pupae with butterflies appearing again in spring.","White butterfly caterpillars feed on all brassica crops
While small, the larvae feed on surface tissue of the leaves but as they grow they eat through the leaf. In time the tissue between the leaf veins is skeletonised leaving only the leaf ribs
Damage by the caterpillars on forage crops, while noticeable, is seldom severe but occasionally can be. However when combined with damage from other brassica pests some form of control may be warranted
Scouting the crop will allow detection of caterpillars while they are small and allow treatment before damage reaches a high level.","Several biological control agents and generalist predators usually exert a high level of control of caterpillars
When damage by white butterfly caterpillars on their own or in combination with other brassica pests is severe application of an insecticide can be worthwhile. Several insecticides are registered for use against white butterfly caterpillars in forage brassica crops. These should be applied as early as possible to prevent damage becoming extensive.

11,weed,Alligator Weed,Alternanthera philoxeroides,"Low-growing, non-woody perennial
Long horizontal stems (stolons), up to 10 metres long, can float on the surface of water, forming rafts, or grow onto banks, forming closely matted clumps
Leaves are shiny, spear-shaped, in opposite pairs or whorls, 2-7 cm long and about 1-2 cm wide
Small white papery flower heads, similar to clover heads, 1-2 cm in diameter, on 2-7 cm stalks generally appear from November to March
Stems grow to 60 cm high and have large, hollow internodes
On land, adventitious roots and thickened taproots form, stems are shorter, and internodes smaller and less hollow.","Origin

Originally from Brazil, and now a major weed problem in parts of the United States, Australia, China, India, Thailand and Indonesia, this plant has been described as one of the world’s worst aquatic and terrestrial weeds
First discovered in New Zealand in the northern Wairoa River, near Dargaville, in 1906. It is believed to have arrived with ship’s ballast water
Now widespread in Northland as a serious weed of waterways and cropping land. Common in Auckland waterways and there are several infestations in a range of habitats in the Waikato.
Ecology

Low-growing herb that grows very quickly in summer
Mats may extend for 15 m over the water surface and become so robust they can support the weight of a person
Tends to be more prostrate on land, developing a very deep root system
Does not produce viable seed, so reproduction is only vegetative
Frost and ice kill exposed stems and leaves, but  protected stems can survive to support the next season’s growth
Responds to high levels of nutrients and withstands some salinity in flowing brackish water.","As a terrestrial weed it grows rapidly, particularly under warm, wet conditions, and can out-compete crops and pastures
Alligator weed will take up heavy metals from the soil and is known to be toxic to some livestock
Aquatic alligator weed can rapidly spread in streams and drainage canals, clogging them with vegetation and trapping sediments, thus increasing risk of flooding
In natural wetland areas alligator weed is a threat to native flora and fauna and is extremely difficult to eradicate once established in such a habitat
Alligator weed is listed in the National Pest Plant Accord and it is therefore illegal to propagate and knowingly spread this plant.","Ensure that alligator weed fragments are not carried on vehicles or equipment
Farmers should protect their properties by:
insisting all contractors clean their equipment before entering the farm
ensuring supplementary feed brought onto the farm is weed free
ensuring aggregates, soil and sand brought onto the farm are weed free
To prevent the spread of alligator weed and other aquatic weeds such as didymo, boat operators should clean their boats and trailers when leaving waterways.",Alligator-Weed.jpg,Alligator-Weed-4.jpg
12,weed,Barley grass,Critesion spp,"Annual grass that germinates in autumn and sets seed in summer
Seeds have long bristly awns that stick to clothing and wool
Before plants flower they can be recognised by the slender but well-developed auricles that often encircle the base of the stem
Emerging leaves are rolled and leaves are often twisted
Leaves have a few hairs (unlike brome grasses which are very hairy)
Ligule is short, white and irregularly toothed","Origin

Originated in the Mediterranean, southwest Europe, and parts of Asia.
Life cycle

Annual grass that mostly germinates in autumn and sets seed in summer
Germination can occur in spring and plants then produce seed late in a shortened growing season
Seeds have little dormancy and most germinate in the autumn following their production. A few can last longer if trapped under dry cow-pats or tree branches.
Critesion species (barley grasses) present in New Zealand

Six species of barley grass are present in New Zealand: Critesion glaucum, C. hystrix, C. jubatum, C. marinum, C. murinum and C. secalinum. Differences between the six species are small and they can all be managed in the same way (i.e. same control methods)
Barley grass (Critesion murinum) is the most common and inhabits disturbed areas (e.g. stock camps) in pastures, and sometimes in crops. Barley grass is divided into two subspecies murinum and subspecies leporinum: the latter tends to occur in drier areas
Squirrel tail grass (C. jubatum) has long soft awns (which may have a pink tinge) and is only found in damp salt pans in Central Otago
Salt barley grass (C. marinum) and Mediterranean barley grass (C. hystrix) mostly grow on salt-affected pastures, salty marshes, and coastal areas
C. secalinum is a perennial grass, unlike the other five, which are annuals, and is only found near Porangahau in coastal Hawkes Bay.
Benefits

Provides good-quality feed in autumn and during winter when plants are in the vegetative stage
Used for cover-cropping in Europe, in olive groves to prevent erosion in mountainous areas in Spain, and in vineyards in Turkey. An additional benefit is that barley grass tolerates drought well.","Occurrence

Predominately a weed of high fertility soils, although salt barley grass and Mediterranean barley grass are prevalent on low fertility soils
Compete more strongly in pastures in nitrogen-enriched soils
Prevalent on stock camps, along fence lines and shelter belts and other disturbed or high usage areas where pasture cover is damaged in late summer and early autumn
Impact on pasture

Provides low quality forage during late spring as the plants begin to flower
Sheep avoid grazing barley grass when the seed heads emerge
Avoidance of barley grass places more pressure on better pasture species. Barley grass can tolerate conditions of water stress better than other species and being an annual, avoids summer drought. Perennial grasses on the other hand, will be selectively grazed over summer. Grazing pressure, in combination with water stress, can lead to the decline of perennial species in pastures and reduce their ability to compete against annual grass weeds, such as barley grass. This enables undesirable annual species to gain a stronger foothold over time.
Impact on stock

Sharp, awned seeds can penetrate fleeces, pelts, carcasses, hocks, mouths and eyes of grazing livestock
If seed contamination is severe, stock growth rates can be reduced
Fine wool sheep tend to pick up the seeds more easily than sheep with coarse wool, although the actual skin damage is less in sheep with fine wool
Lambs are much more susceptible than older sheep, as their skin is more easily penetrated. They spend more time lying on the ground, which increases the chance of them picking up barley grass seed
In 1971 Bob Taylor, a New Zealand farmer, wrote “Since 1966, areas suspected or known to contain appreciable numbers of viable seed have been fenced off, grazed a few times between January and September by sheep which were allowed in only to eat on their feet. This procedure has greatly helped to bring barley grass under control. Only about one new infestation of barley grass appears each year, never containing many plants. In earlier times, as many as a thousand barley grass plants appeared in a new infestation arising from seed carried in the wool of only sixty sheep. Barley grass is no longer collected in sacks, but in very small plastic bags. Half the lamb pelts at one time were punctured, but none are now.”
Sheep dogs sometimes pick up barley grass seeds between their toes, leading to sores and lameness.","As with most grass weeds, an integrated approach is important with a focus on maintaining a healthy cover of desirable, competitive pasture species – especially in late summer and autumn. Tools for this include grazing management, fertiliser, herbicide and physical removal of plants.
Grazing management
Seeds have very little dormancy and do not survive for long in the soil; so that grazing management to prevent seed production can control barley grass within a few years
Summer: Identify areas of barley grass infestation from their seed heads and mark the areas on your farm map. Decide on the best method of control for the area depending on access to boom-spray, ease of controlled grazing, potential damage to pelts. (Is the area used for grazing lambs?) Lax grazing during summer helps maintain pasture cover and can reduce barley grass establishment in autumn
Autumn: Heavy grazing may be required in paddocks to be treated with herbicides (pastures must be short for some herbicides to work effectively). Removal of standing pasture will also increase access for boom-sprays and other equipment
Winter: Rest infested paddocks from grazing if possible. In response, barley grass produces plants with fewer tillers which have their growing points higher from the ground
Spring: Graze more heavily. Stock removes the growing point; the tiller dies and no seed is produced. Grazing pressure must be maintained to prevent new tillers and seed heads from being formed, or at least to reduce the height of the barley grass seed heads. This reduces the damage that seeds cause to sheep.
Pasture species/cultivars
Some pasture species and cultivars are more resistant to barley grass than others, often because they withstand summer drought better. Novel endophytes can help pastures resist weed invasion and spread. Endophytes can allow pasture species to be more drought tolerant and resistant to insect attack. This enables sown pasture species to grow more vigorously, making it more difficult for weeds to establish. Some high endophyte ryegrass cultivars and low-growing cultivars of   cocksfoot seem to be more effective.
 

Fertiliser application
Ensure soil fertility levels are appropriate as this can increase the vigour of sown pasture species and reduce barley grass establishment
Note that barley grass is often found on high fertility, disturbed areas such as stock camps, along fence lines, around gate ways and watering points. In these areas, it is difficult for competitive pasture species to establish and suppress barley grass.
Mowing/grubbing
Clippings should be collected and dumped securely to prevent the seeds from ripening
Small numbers of plants can be grubbed or manually removed.
Chemical control
Winter-cleaning: herbicides can be applied during vegetative stage at levels sufficient to selectively kill barley grass plants
Spraying barley grass in summer with glyphosate damages pasture species and creates a perfect seed bed for germination of surviving seeds.
 

Herbicides used to control barley grass in pastures include the following:

ALWAYS READ PRODUCT LABELS BEFORE APPLYING

Active ingredient	When to apply	Residual effect	Grass damage	Clover damage
paraquat or glyphosate + simazine	At the green seed head stage	Yes	Yes	Severe
dalapon	Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth	Moderate	Slight	No
dalapon + TCA	Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth	Yes	Slight	No
ethofumesate	Mid-autumn until mid-winter, during vegetative growth	Yes	Not to ryegrass	Severe
propyzamide	Winter during vegetative growth	Yes	Severe	No
Effectiveness of herbicides depends on:
Application rate
Soil moisture conditions and plant stress
Pasture height and size of plants being sprayed
As glyphosate will kill all plants it contacts, patches of bare ground (gaps) are created, this, neither glyphosate nor paraquat are recommended for barley grass control
Simazine can be added to glyphosate or paraquat to provide residual control of barley grass (simazine is residual in the soil and prevents seeds from germinating)
Ethofumesate can be applied to ryegrass pastures (ryegrass is tolerant to ethofumesate), but ethofumesate kills clovers.
Consult your farm consultant, industry rep or the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual for more information about chemical control.

Suggestion based on size of infestation
Small patches:
Remove manually or apply herbicide
Note that applying herbicide once flowering has started may allow seeds to form and patches to grow in successive years.
50% paddock cover:
Apply herbicide
Graze laxly over summer and early autumn so that sown pasture species are not overgrazed. This enables sown species to grow vigorously after autumn rains and suppress barley grass
Keep lambs off affected paddocks.
Most of paddock covered:
Consider resowing, using recommended species of grasses with appropriate endophytes for the region.",Barley-grass.jpg,Barley-grass-2.jpg
13,weed,Blackberry,Rubus fruticosus,"Prickly perennial woody shrub, with long arching branches, often reaching more than 2 m tall
Stems have very sharp backward pointing thorns and can reach up to 8 m long, becoming entangled with each other
White to pink flowers 2 – 3 cm across, each with five petals and many stamens occur in clusters in summer to late spring
Edible blackberries appear in summer to autumn
Leaves usually have five to seven oval leaflets, with prickly stalks and mid-ribs
Underside of leaf is pale in colour
New shoots can arise from the roots
Common in waste areas, hedges, roadsides, scrub, and sometimes even in swampy ground.","Origin

Originally introduced by early European settlers for hedgerows, soil erosion control and as a food source
Now declared a pest plant it invades natural ecosystems, smothering native vegetation. It is also a problem in pasture, plantation forests and other disturbed areas.
Related species

Three native blackberry species are present in New Zealand: Rubus australis, Rubus cissoides and Rubus schmidelioides
These are found sprawling or climbing in native bush. Stems are long and semi-woody with backward pointing thorns, often obstructing humans or animals as they move through the bush.
Life cycle

Seeds germinate in the spring
Stems root when they arch over and contact the ground, forming daughter plants
Seeds are mainly dispersed by birds feeding on the berries. Other dispersal mechanisms include water (rivers, creeks, and floodwaters), soil movement and animals which graze blackberry fruits
When the plant has been grazed or suffered other physical damage it can re-sprout from the roots.
Benefits

Provides food and shelter for many birds
Provides food and nectar for bees and small insects
May help in the regeneration of native species.","Impact on pasture

Can invade poorly maintained pasture, reducing the stock-carrying capacity
Can be a problem in forest plantations and other disturbed areas.
Impact on stock

Sheep can become tangled in the sprawling canes and starve to death
Goats will readily graze blackberry, sheep will eat fresh growth, but cattle avoid it.","Grazing management
Blackberry can be grazed by sheep and goats, especially in the seedling stage, and this can help suppress its growth. Goats fenced onto areas of blackberry or tethered near it can destroy plants completely.
Manual removal
Individual plants or small patches can be dug out. However, ensure root crowns and stems are disposed of properly. If left on the ground they may re-sprout and form ne roots.
Chemical control
Herbicides can be used between late summer and autumn
When spraying re-growth, make sure stems are at least one metre long with fully expanded leaves; large leaves absorb herbicides more effectively.

Biological control
Blackberry rust (Phragmidium violaceum)
Native to Europe, the rust was first discovered here in 1990 and is thought to have blown over from Australia
The rust will infect most plants; some may have immunity to it
Causes small (2-3 mm diameter) purple-brown spots on the upper surface of the leaves and yellow or black powdery spots on the underside of leaves
There are different strains of the rust but  telling them apart is very difficult
Signs of the rust can be seen any time of the year but are most prominent in autumn
In the summer the rust produces yellow spores: heavily infected leaves are killed
Manually spreading the rust won’t help; plants not affected will probably be immune to it. However, slashing plants can increase their vulnerability to rust.",blackberry-flowers.jpg,Blackberry-fruit.jpg
14,weed,Bracken,Pteridium esculentum,"Bracken is a fern, producing spores not seeds, which is native to New Zealand
It spreads by means of underground stems (rhizomes) that send up leaves at intervals
It is taller-growing than ring fern, usually up to 1.5 m tall
Rhizomes are stiff, 5-15 mm thick, and branch frequently
Stipes (leaf stalks) are erect, rigid, dark brown, glossy but hairy when young
The main axis of the leaf is stout, brown and hairy when young
Fronds (leaves) are dark green, up to 1 m long, unrolling as they grow
Spore-bearing organs (sporangia) are borne along the underside margins of the smallest leaf segments
Although bracken has been used as human food in New Zealand, parts of the plant are toxic and carcinogenic to humans and livestock
Plants are very ‘plastic’ in behaviour, being small and stunted in dry rocky places and sometimes reaching 4 m high on forest margins
Dry, dead fronds burn very readily.","Origin
Bracken, like ring fern, is a native to New Zealand. Pteridium esculentum is also found in Australia and the Society Islands but Pteridium aquilinum, a very close relative, is widespread throughout the world
Pteridium esculentum rapidly increased in area in New Zealand as early humans cleared and burned forests and it is now common throughout the country in open habitats.
Life cycle
Bracken is a fern, reproducing by spores that germinate to produce a small prothallus This develops male and female sexual organs that in turn produce male and female gametes, resulting in the formation of a new fern plant
Bracken spores are very small and are released between late summer and autumn They can be carried for considerable distances on air currents.
Benefits
Bracken rhizomes were used by Maori as a starchy food
Dry bracken stalks have multiple uses as play things, from arrows to kite structures.","Impact on farming
Tall-growing bracken can make stock access and mustering very difficult
Impact on pasture
Bracken, like ring fern, can form very dense cover, smothering useful pasture species
Bracken uses valuable soil nutrients for growth and these nutrients are locked up in the fronds until they eventually break down.
Impact on stock
Some strains of bracken appear to be more toxic than others, but all can be poisonous to livestock if large quantities are eaten
Bracken contains carcinogens that can cause cancerous lesions in livestock.
Impact on forestry
Bracken competes strongly with young trees and is also a fire risk.","Bracken is rhizomatous and difficult to kill
Bracken commonly grows in poorer grazing land, therefore, its control may not be economically feasible.
Grazing
Grazing is not an effective method of control, but heavy treading by cattle can be used to crush the new fern shoots as they are emerging.
Mowing
Repeated mowing or crushing can be used as control measures. However, where bracken grows on steep hillsides this may not be practical.
Pasture species/cultivars
Establishment of new competitive pasture species, suited to local conditions, can be used after initial clearance of fern, and may, if adequately limed and fertilised, help to prevent reestablishment.
Forestry
Trees can form a dense canopy and shade out bracken but the trees must be protected from bracken when young.
Chemical control
Bracken is generally very difficult to kill with herbicides, though it is susceptible to glyphosate and high rates of metsulfuron, both of which are damaging to grasses
Two selective herbicides – asulam and primisulfuron will control bracken within pine forests. Asulam should be applied without surfactant when releasing young trees
Asulam (Asulox) is selective in pastures and should be applied when bracken fronds are fully expanded but before they are affected by frost (late summer to early autumn). Its effect on the bracken will not be obvious until the following spring
Biocontrol
No biological control agents are available for either species.",Pteridium-esculentum-b-default-picture1.jpg,Pteridium-esculentum-e1-700x467.jpeg

Flower spikelets individually borne on the end of branched panicles, which can be between 15 – 30 cm long
Seeds are egg-shaped and encased in a shiny seed coat approximately 3 x 2 mm in size
Seedlings grow rapidly into upright plants
Roots are shallow and weak, making plants easy to uproot.","Origin and habitat
Originated in the tropics and temperate regions and has been grown as a domestic crop for at least 2000 years
Broom corn millet is a widely grown crop for human consumption and birdseed in the northern hemisphere
In 1970, a wild biotype with black seeds emerged and quickly became weedy, producing more dry matter, reaching a greater height and producing twice as much seed.
Life-cycle
Germination starts at the beginning of the warm season and continues throughout the growing season
Seeds have no dormancy and can germinate rapidly once conditions are suitable
Because of its large seed size, seeds can emerge from deep within the soil. In one study seeds emerged from 120 mm in a range of soil types
Growth is rapid and is mainly determined by temperature as it uses a C4 photosynthetic pathway

Originated in the tropics and temperate regions and has been grown as a domestic crop for at least 2000 years
Broom corn millet is a widely grown crop for human consumption and birdseed in the northern hemisphere
In 1970, a wild biotype with black seeds emerged and quickly became weedy, producing more dry matter, reaching a greater height and producing twice as much seed.
Life-cycle
Germination starts at the beginning of the warm season and continues throughout the growing season
Seeds have no dormancy and can germinate rapidly once conditions are suitable

16,weed,Cape weed,Arctotheca calendula,"An annual species with a low growing, flattened rosette of leaves common in short turf areas like lawns and playing fields, roadsides and coastal waste areas
Leaves greyish-green, deeply cut into many lobes, with a larger terminal lobe
Underside of leaves much paler and covered in woolly hairs
Attractive solitary flower head 3-4 cm across, with yellow ray florets (‘petals’) and a dark purple centre
The pappus is very ‘woolly’ giving the seed head a strawberry-like appearance.
Other similar species present in New Zealand
Plants with similar flowers are species of gazania (Gazania linearis and Gazania rigens) and the African daisy Arctotis stoechadifolia. These are common garden escapes, often found along roadsides, where garden rubbish has been thrown out, or on sand dunes near coastal settlements.","Origin
Native to South Africa (hence the name ‘Cape weed’, with a capital C)
First recorded in New Zealand in 1869
Now common throughout the North Island, and in areas of Marlborough, Nelson and Canterbury
Found along roadsides, in waste places, on consolidated sands and in short turf such as lawns, playing fields, and pasture
Originally confined to coastal areas but now increasingly found inland.
Life cycle
Cape weed produces large amounts of seed and when it dies off in summer it leaves bare areas in which its own seedlings can establish
The woolly pappus readily sticks to socks, animals etc. but is not widely dispersed by wind
Plants are in flower between October and December
Rosettes are large and the plants compete strongly against other turf species. Capeweed can dominate large areas of depleted pasture
Adapted to most soil types but probably grows best on lighter soils and is most aggressive on fertile soils.
Benefits
May help prevent soil erosion.","Impact on pasture and livestock
Smothers and replaces more desirable and highly producing pasture species
Capeweed tends to self-perpetuate since its seeds germinate in the bare spaces left by the death of the parent plants
Difficult for cattle to graze
Foliage has poisoned cattle in New Zealand and cattle and sheep in Australia, probably due to high levels of nitrate.","Grazing management
Pastures should be kept dense in autumn to prevent Cape weed re-establishing each year. This can be done by selection of appropriate grass cultivars or by grazing management, especially rotational grazing.
Chemical control
Once present in lawns, best control is by using clopyralid, or herbicides containing dicamba or picloram
Note that all these herbicides leave residues in the turf after application so clippings should not be composted until several months afterwards
Note also that picloram is highly soluble and can leach to the root zone of adjacent trees with disastrous results
Young rosettes can be killed using MCPA or 2,4-D
Older plants can only be killed by clover-damaging herbicides.
Integrated control
Cape weed establishes best after turf has opened up during drought, so avoid this if possible, by using turf or pasture cultivars that tolerate dry conditions
In lawns where Cape weed is just starting to establish, care should be taken not to spread the seeds to new areas
A possible strategy to avoid seed dispersal is to leave mowing infested patches to last, while the Cape weed is flowering, then clean the mower before using it again.",Arctotheca-calendula-ap.jpg,Arctotheca-calendula-ak.jpeg
17,weed,Dandelion,Taraxacum officinale,"Common perennial weed, recognised by the single, large yellow flower borne on top of a leafless, unbranched hollow stem
Stem rises from a flat rosette of basal leaves
All parts of dandelion contain a milky sap
Leaves are thin and smooth, growing from the crown with teeth pointing towards the base. Midribs are hollow towards the stem
Young plants have broad leaves with several points. Deep lobes do not appear until several leaves have grown
Seedlings have dark green, shiny, hairless leaves.","Origin
Native to Eurasia
Introduced to many other parts of the world, including Australia and North America.
Life cycle
Dandelion is a perennial weed which can flower from early spring into autumn, but flowering peaks in October
Seeds are dispersed by the wind. The seedhead is a characteristic ball of fluffy seeds – children tell the time by the number of puffs to blow them all off!
Benefits
Beneficial in droughts due to its deep root system which also brings nitrogen and other nutrients to the soil surface
Eaten as a vegetable in many parts of the world
Dandelion can be used for medicinal purposes – its constituents have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities
Roots have been used as a substitute for coffee.","Occurrence
Common in pastures, lawns and waste ground. Occasionally found in arable crops but is common in perennial crops such as lucerne
Most plentiful in Canterbury, where it often invades lucerne crops.
Impact on pasture
Thrives in dairy pastures
Dandelion reduces yields of agriculture crops, slows the drying of hay and acts as a host to pests and diseases.","Dandelion is difficult to control because pieces of leftover root from as deep as 20 cm can grow into new plants
Control is easier to achieve at the vegetative stage than at flowering stage.
Grazing management
Can be kept in check by sheep.
Chemical control
Chemical control measures are seldom warranted in pastures as dandelion is outcompeted in vigorous swards
MCPA or 2,4-D would provide sufficient  control, but clover suppression probably results in more loss of production than the presence of dandelion
Young seedlings may be more susceptible to MCPA than 2,4-D
Hexazinone can provide a varying degree of control in established lucerne but grazing the lucerne before treating with herbicide reduces the amount of lucerne leaf exposed to herbicide and thus reduces crop damage
Many of the selective pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides used in field and horticultural crops help prevent seedling establishment or provide a varying degree of control of existing plants.",Dandelion-3.jpg,Dandelion-6.jpg
18,weed,Giant buttercup,Ranunculus acris,"Perennial, reaching up to 1 m tall
Yellow glossy flowers 15 – 25 mm across with 5 petals appearing mainly between November and April
A short rhizome (horizontal underground stem up to about 100 mm long) with fibrous remains of old leaves, axillary buds and fleshy roots
Leaves highly variable in size (can be as big as an outstretched hand), hairy, three primary lobes, highly variable lobe dissection, long hairy petioles
Genetically highly diverse species complex with up to 6 different chloroplast cytotypes from Europe coexisting in New Zealand dairy pastures
Avoided by dairy cattle due to bitter tasteweb-based application
The species is common in swamp and wasteland areas, river flats and dairy pastures in high-rainfall areas.","Origin
Multiple introductions from Europe (its native range)
Brought to New Zealand by early settlers
Has invaded many other countries in the Northern and Southern hemispheres including North America, South Africa, Tasmania and Australia.
Life cycle
Giant buttercup is a short-lived rhizomatous perennial, with individual plants flowering and producing seeds and daughter rhizomes for several years before dying
Seeds germinate from late autumn to late spring
Leaf growth peaks in late spring
Leafy daughter shoots are produced throughout summer and autumn as branches on the parent plant’s rhizomes, resulting in a slow outward creep of the plant and the creation of patches
Flowering stems die back after the seeds are shed and are replaced by the daughter shoots which overwinter as leafy rosettes
Seeds fall close to the parent plant and some can remain dormant in the soil for several years
The seeds have a small hook enabling them to attach to, and be readily spread long distances by grazing cattle and other animals
Other long-distance seed dispersal vectors include hay, farming equipment, roadside mowers, footwear, clothes and flood waters.
Benefits
Provides nectar for bees
Scented flowers attract and provide food for moths and many other small insects
In the past the plant has been used medicinally as a last resort cure for syphilis. However, safer medicines are now readily available.","Impact on pasture
At peak cover in late spring, a dense population of giant buttercup can occupy 50% of a pasture (Bourdôt et al. 2003) and at worst, there may be no grazing available
Dairy and other cattle avoid grazing the plant and its surrounding pasture thus it reduces the pasture’s stock-carrying capacity in proportion to its coverage
On a typical Golden Bay dairy farm with a paddock average peak cover of giant buttercup of 12%, overall farm profit is reduced by $1,040/ha or 36% (Bourdôt et al. 2012)
At a national scale, the value of lost milk solids production due to giant buttercup could be as high as $592 million per year (Saunders et al. 2017)
Resistance to herbicides that once provided adequate control has evolved in giant buttercup populations on some dairy farms, leaving these farmers with reduced options for control (Lamoureaux & Bourdôt 2007)
All of New Zealand is climatically suitable for giant buttercup and dairy farmers should learn how to distinguish it from the other less troublesome species of buttercup (Bourdôt et al. 2013)
Giant buttercup reduces the amount of clover and grass in a pasture through competition
Rapid increase in the amount of giant buttercup in a paddock can occur due to seedling establishment in ‘pugged’ areas in a pasture (Lusk et al. 2009).
Impact on stock
Protoanemonin, a toxin created during the ingestion of giant buttercup can cause blistering of the tongue and lips of cattle, ventricular fibrillation, intestinal disorders and respiratory failure
There are no recorded cases of stock poisoning due to giant buttercup in New Zealand","Grazing management
Giant buttercup may be eaten by sheep which could explain why it is never a problem in sheep-grazed pastures. Cattle will not eat the plant throughout most of the year which makes it much more of a problem on dairy farms
Dairy and beef cattle encourage giant buttercup by eating its competitors (e.g. grasses, clover). Overgrazing should be avoided
Pugging encourages giant buttercup by creating bare soil where seeds can germinate and rhizomes can invade. It should be avoided.
Grubbing / mowing of pastures
Mowing a pasture containing giant buttercup before it flowers (in November) can prevent seeds forming
If the plants are mown after flowering, seeds may be spread by the mower
Pre- or post-graze mowing may be effective in reducing the buttercup over the longer term, resulting in more edible dry matter in the pasture and higher paddock milk solids yields
Pasture growth-enhancing additives such as gibberellic acid and liquid nitrogen are unlikely to be useful alone or as additives to herbicides according to the results of Sustainable Farming Fund project SFF 401449 (2014-2017)
Hay made from paddock containing giant buttercup will contain the seeds of the weed and should not be fed out in buttercup-free paddocks
Plants can be dug out, but care is required to ensure that rhizomes are completely removed as these can easily re-sprout
Disposal of removed plants should be carried out carefully to prevent the ripening and dispersal of seeds.
Chemical control
The herbicides occurring in products with label claims for giant buttercup (Table 1) fall into 4 mode-of-action groups
A giant buttercup population will evolve resistance to all herbicides in a particular mode-of-action group through repeated use of one or several members of the group
Rotation between mode-of-action groups will delay or prevent the development of herbicide resistance
Mode-of-action mixtures (e.g. tank mix of MCPA + flumetsulam) may help delay the development of herbicide resistance
Aminopyralid + triclopyr or aminopyralid alone are the most effective herbicides for giant buttercup control (Table 1)
Although bentazone, MCPA, MCPB, thifensulfuron-methyl and flumetsulam are not so effective (Table 1), they provide options for herbicide mode-of-action rotation.
Herbicides applied in late winter/spring will be most effective
Check withholding periods before the use of any of these chemicals on pasture – there can be a withholding period of several weeks with some herbicides.

2Data from Sustainable Farming Fund project SFF 401449 (2014-2017). The reductions in the giant buttercup ground cover are averages over assessments made 2 and 7 months after treatment (18 paddocks, 2 on each of dairy farms 1 to 9), 19 months after treatment (12 paddocks, 2 on each of farms 1 to 6) and 31 months after treatment (6 paddocks, 2 on each of farms 1 to 3). There were large differences between paddocks in the initial cover of the buttercup and considerable variation between paddocks and farms in responses to the herbicides.

Decision Support Tool
To aid decision making in the choice of herbicide top control giant buttercup, AgResearch has developed web-based application for dairy farmers and consultants.
Biocontrol
Two naturally occurring plant pathogenic fungi found on giant buttercup are known to damage the plant:
A species of Gnomonia, will infect the plant but not cause death
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causes a soft-rot disease and death of plants. While lethal to the giant buttercup, this fungus does not damage pasture grasses and clovers
The use of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum as a mycoherbicide and the potential of insects as biocontrol agents are topic of current research. The fungus has not been successful in the field experiment of project SFF 401449 .
A classical biological programme for giant buttercup in New Zealand is not being pursued because of the complications in finding a suitably efficacious and safe agent due to the many native buttercup species and the complex genetic makeup of giant buttercup.",Giant-buttercup-flower.jpg,Giant-buttercup.jpeg
19,weed,Hemlock,Conium maculatum,"Tall, branching, foul-smelling, ferny-leaved annual or biennial with purple spotted stems arising from a woody taproot; all parts of the plant are poisonous
Small white flowers in umbels on stems up to 2 m tall
Plants form a low-growing rosette of ferny leaves in their first year and the tall flowering stems usually emerge late in the same year or in the second year
Leaves in the rosette form can be confused with ferns or with the superficially similar wild carrot (Daucus carota), but the leaf stalks of hemlock are hairless and often have a purplish tinge
Sometimes also confused with fennel (Foeniculum vulgare). However, fennel has yellow flowers, the leaves are more finely divided and smell of aniseed. By contrast hemlock leaves have an unpleasant strong musty odour.
Has been known to poison children who have used the hollow, hairless stems as ‘pea-shooters’.","Origin and habitat
Native to Europe, Asia and North Africa, hemlock has now spread to many other parts of the world
Probably introduced to New Zealand by herbalists in the mid-1800s but some introductions may have been accidental, with seeds arriving in hay, straw or bedding
Added to the Noxious Weeds Act in 1902 and currently listed as a Pest Plant on several Regional Pest Management Strategies – see your local Regional Council website for details
Now very common throughout New Zealand in waste places, riverbeds and damp areas, although sometimes also found in drier locations
Very poisonous in all its parts, slightly less so when dried. Reputedly hemlock was the poison the Greek philosopher Socrates was made to drink after he had been found guilty of corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens, amongst other charges.
Life-cycle
In its first year the plant forms a large rosette and in the second year a tall flowering stem emerges. The plant dies after it has flowered
Seeds are quite large and unlikely to be blown far from the parent plant. However, they may float and be carried along waterways
Most seeds emerge as soon as conditions are suitable for germination, although a few may survive in the soil for up to 3 years.
Benefits
Hemlock was probably first introduced for herbal purposes and used medicinally as a sedative and antispasmodic. However, it is rarely used today as an overdose can have disastrous effect on the patient.","Hemlock has been responsible for non-fatal poisonings of children in New Zealand. Children may mistake the leaves for edible garden plants, chew the seeds (the most toxic part), or use the hollow stems as pea-shooters or whistles
Can be a problem in reserves and other walkways accessed by the public.
Impact to agriculture
Individual plants are usually avoided by livestock, and take up significant pasture space, and can therefore displace more valuable fodder species
A problem weed in maize crops in Manawatu and some other locations
A very common weed in paddocks grazed solely by horses, particularly if overgrazed; its presence severely limits grass growth.
Impact on livestock
Fortunately livestock normally avoid hemlock so do not suffer from poisoning
Tired and hungry animals, such as those driven or mob-stocked, are at greatest danger when exposed to large infestations of the plant
Plants become more palatable to livestock, but no less poisonous, after being sprayed or cut, so stock must not be allowed access to a sprayed infestation
Dairy cattle are the most publicised casualties of poisoning from hemlock, although in 1950 a circus elephant died of hemlock poisoning at Lower Hutt.","Grazing management
Do not allow livestock access to hemlock after it has been treated with herbicides, after it has been cut, or when the animals are tired and very hungry
Dense, vigorous pasture will prevent hemlock seedlings from becoming established.
Non-chemical control
Mowing of flowering plants gives temporary control, but livestock must not be allowed access to cut and wilted plant material.
Chemical control
Young hemlock plants can be treated with 2,4-D or flumetsulam without harming most other pasture components
Larger rosettes or flowering plants are best controlled by spot treatment with aminopyralid, clopyralid or dicamba, or treated with a rotary weed wiper using a herbicide such as glyphosate. All of these herbicides damage clovers, some of them for weeks or months, although glyphosate is the least damaging
Best controlled with post-emergence herbicides in crops such as maize
Do not allow livestock access to paddocks after hemlock has been sprayed until after the plants have lost their green colour
In orchards and waste areas, glyphosate gives effective control.",Conium-maculatum-ab.jpg,Conium-maculatum-k.jpg
20,weed,Ragwort,Jacobaea vulgaris,"Ragwort has characteristic bright yellow flowers, visible from a great distance in summer
Biennial or perennial with a fibrous root system
Forms a dense rosette of dark green, deeply dissected leaves, each with a large blunt terminal lobe, in its first year
Second year produces a flower stem up to 1.2 m high
A compact flat-topped inflorescence composed of about 12 composite flowers, each about 2cm across, appears between November and April
Leaves on the flower stem are also deeply dissected and have no stalks, instead clasping the main stem. They do not have a large terminal lobe
Plants have an unpleasant smell when crushed.","Origin
Ragwort originated from Europe, Asia and Siberia and has become a serious weed in North America, Australia and New Zealand. It was first recorded in New Zealand in the South Island (Dunedin) in 1874
Occurs throughout New Zealand in beef cattle and dairy pastures, but also in open forest, swampy areas, along roadsides, railways and along riverbeds. It can become prevalent in conservation areas and national parks. It is also found in the Chatham Islands. Ragwort is more common in higher rainfall areas (> 870 mm)
Often found on lighter soils and does not grow as well on heavier soils. It appears to adapt to a wide pH range.
Lifecycle
A ragwort plant can produce over 50,000 seeds, some of which can last for up to 20 years in the soil (see references listed under ‘further information’)
Most seeds are only spread short distances by the wind, and fall within 15 m of the parent plant, although a few may be carried kilometres. Ragwort plants found in the Southern Alps near Arthurs Pass were thought to have originated from seed blown by strong nor’westers from Westland
Seeds germinate in winter or early spring, often in bare areas. Most seeds germinate in the year after their production. However, mortality of seedlings and young plants is high, with few surviving to produce flowers. At three North Island sites 80% of seedlings died each year before flowering
Prefers a sunny location for establishment and optimal growth. Seeds germinate faster if covered by a thin layer of soil than if left on the soil surface. Germination is lower in the presence of other vegetation, and dry summers reduce seedling establishment
After germination the plant forms a rosette which grows through winter and spring. In its second year, it ‘bolts’ to produce an upright flower stem which branches towards the top and forms the characteristic flat-topped cluster of bright yellow flowers. After flowering plants usually die
Ragwort doesn’t just grow from seeds. New shoots can also grow from root fragments left in the soil when the plants are pulled out
If ragwort plants have been grazed, cut or damaged so that flowering is prevented, they can produce new buds from the crown or send up new shoots from the roots. In this way ragwort can become a perennial plant
Ragwort is subject to Pest Plant Management Strategies in most regions of NZ. Details are available from individual regional councils or unitary authorities. It has been regarded as a noxious plant in NZ since 1900.
Benefits
While ragwort is a serious weed of pastures it has some benefits. Flowers provide food for small wasps, butterflies and other insects and seeds provide food for birds. Despite it being poisonous to humans, it has been used historically as a herbal medicine.","Alkaloid compounds in ragwort are poisonous and damage the liver of horses and cattle. The compounds are less dangerous for sheep as they are generally broken down by bacteria in the rumen, although long-term exposure of sheep to ragwort can still cause symptoms that can be mistaken for those of facial eczema
Older sheep are better than younger sheep in controlling ragwort, because they are more tolerant of the toxin and tend to eat the crown and growing points of the rosette, while younger sheep generally feed entirely on the younger leaves
The plant is more palatable and has fewer poisonous alkaloids at the rosette stage than in full bloom. Sheep may even gain a preference for ragwort after they have acquired a taste for it
Ragwort may also be toxic to deer
The toxic alkaloids cause milk and honey taint
It has been estimated that ragwort causes losses to the Australian dairy industry of more than 4 million dollars per year (see references listed under ‘further information’).","Grazing management
Ragwort can be grazed by sheep or goats. However, cattle rarely eat ragwort seedlings or rosettes
Damage to pasture cover or soil disturbance increases ragwort seed germination
Continuous grazing, as opposed to rotational grazing, is more likely to lead to ragwort infestations. Under continuous stocking livestock can graze selectively which can lead to overgrazing and ragwort establishment
Once the seedling has formed a rosette, it competes well with grasses and clovers. At this stage, only tall pastures such as a hay crop may reduce its growth.
Pasture species/cultivars
Maintaining a dense, vigorous pasture can help prevent ragwort germination and establishment
This can be helped by appropriate stocking rates, irrigation and fertiliser
Superphosphate and urea applications have both been shown to increase pasture growth and suppress ragwort.
Chemical control
Young plants in the rosette stage are easier to control than older plants
2,4-D is more effective on younger than older plants (including older rosettes, budding or flowering plants)
2,4-D and MCPA damage clover. Some products used to control ragwort also damage grasses
Check regarding withholding periods for the chemicals used. There may be a withholding period of up to several weeks before stock are allowed back onto the pasture
Chemicals that can be used include: 2,4-D, dicamba, triclopyr/picloram, metsulfuron, picloram, MCPA and glyphosate.
ALWAYS READ PRODUCT LABELS BEFORE APPLYING

Consult your farm consultant, industry rep or New Zealand Agrichemical Manual for more information about chemical control.

Mowing or grubbing
Small patches of plants can be removed by hand or grubbing. However, plants can re-grow from root fragments left in the ground
Pulled plants should be removed and burned so viable seed does not spread
Larger plants have deep root systems, making it hard to remove all the roots. However, as plants get older, re-growth from root segments is less likely
If plants are mown, they can re-grow and produce multi-crowned plants, each crown with stems. This may prolong the life of the plant and turn it from a biennial to a perennial
Mowing or cutting repeatedly, in combination with appropriate fertilisers, can favour grass growth and help prevent ragwort from establishing.
Ploughing
For large infestations, deep ploughing, followed by summer and autumn cultivations, can kill ragwort plants, re-growth and seedlings.
Integrated pest management
Older plants may be hard to kill. However, one technique is to leave them to die naturally in ungrazed areas, followed by grazing, spot-spraying and maintaining a dense pasture to control the seedlings.
Biocontrol
In recent years the combined effects of biocontrol agents have significantly reduced the incidence of ragwort in most areas.
Cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae)
Cinnabar moths were first established in New Zealand in the 1939s, but only became well established in the southern North Island. In the 1980s moths from there were multiplied and released throughout the country
Cinnabar moths have now established throughout the country but distribution is patchy. However, populations seem to be growing
Moths are about 2 cm long with red and brownish-black markings. Cinnabar moth caterpillars vary in the damage they cause to ragwort plants, sometimes being severe in their effects and sometimes less so. They become brightly coloured as they get older, with smooth, bold, yellow-and-black stripes.
Ragwort flea beetle (Longitarsus jacobaeae)
Ragwort flea beetle was first released in the late 1980s and early 1990s, is now well-established throughout the country and has contributed strongly to the decline of ragwort in New Zealand
Small (2.5–3.8 mm long) golden-brown adults have large hind legs that allow them, when disturbed, to leap 1 m. Larvae are white and feed on the roots, inside the crown, and within the leaf petioles
Heavily-infested plants die and, if plants survive they produce fewer flower stems
The cinnabar moth and the ragwort flea beetle are complementary: cinnabar moth larvae feed on ragwort flowers and leaves in summer and flea larvae feed on the roots, crown and leaf stalks during the rest of the year.
Other biocontrol agents
Ragwort seedfly (Botanophila jacobaeae) was released in the late 1930s, but only established in the Central North Island and has not spread further. The adults are small grey flies and the white larvae feed inside the flower heads, reducing seed production in early flowers but their impact is less later in the season
Ragwort stem and crown boring moth (Cochylis atricapitana) was introduced to the West Coast from Australia in 2005 because other agents seemed not so effective there. Caterpillars mine into the leaves and then into the stem, causing stems to thicken and leaves to bunch up. It has not yet established, so as yet it has had no effects
Similarly, ragwort plume moth (Platyptilia isodactyla) was introduced to the West Coast in 2005. Again it is too soon to see any effects on ragwort populations.",Ragwort-flower.jpg,Ragwort-plant.jpeg
