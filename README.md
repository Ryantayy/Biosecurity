## Biosecurity Guide - Web Application Structure:
### Structure Overview:

**Blueprints and Their Roles:** <br>
- **Agronomist Blueprint:** Primarily caters to agronomists by providing access to view and possibly contribute to the pest/weed directory, alongside managing their professional profiles.<br>
- **Staff Blueprint:** Designed for staff users, focusing on the pest/weed directory (view, add, update, delete), uploading images for pest/weed entries, and managing their profiles. It enables staff to contribute to and maintain the pest/weed database. <br>
Agronomist Blueprint: Although not detailed in your submission, it's implied that this blueprint would cater to agronomists' specific functionalities, likely around viewing and possibly contributing to the pest/weed directory, along with managing their professional profiles. <br>
- **Admin Blueprint:** Handles routes and functionalities specific to the administrative role, including user management (add, edit, delete users), pest/weed directory management, and profile management. It serves as a central hub for system oversight and content management.<br>

**Functionality and Data Flow:**<br>
- **User Management:** Admins have the capability to manage user profiles across different roles, including creating new user accounts, editing existing ones, and removing users from the system. This involves interactions with the database to fetch, update, or delete user-related data.<br>
- **Pest/Weed Directory Management:** Both staff and admin roles can manage the pest/weed directory. This includes adding new entries, updating existing ones, uploading images, and deleting entries as needed. The process involves submitting forms, handling file uploads, and performing database transactions to maintain up-to-date and accurate directory information.<br>
- **Profile Management:** Users across all roles have the ability to view and edit their profiles, change their passwords, and log out. This personalization aspect ensures that users can maintain their account details and security settings as per their preferences.<br>

**Technical Considerations:**<br>
- **Session Management:** User sessions are utilized to manage login states and role-based access control. The session data dictate what resources and routes a user can access, ensuring a secure and personalized user experience.<br>

**Security and Access Control**<br>
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Decorators like @role_required enforce access control, ensuring that users can only access routes and functionalities pertinent to their assigned roles.<br>
- **Password Handling:** The hashing module is used for secure password management, involving hashing passwords before storing them in the database and verifying user login attempts.<br>
<p>This structure facilitates a modular and organized approach to developing and expanding the web application, with clear separation of role-based functionalities for admins, staff, and agronomists. <p/>

### Assumptions and design decisions: <br>
Assumptions: 
- Administrators and staff cannot delete their own profiles.
- Administrators cannot change the role of staff and agronomists, they can only add new users with associated roles.
- Website can be further customised to include more role-specific features.
- Any new users would only be registered through the webpage.

### Design decision: 
The website was crafted with an emphasis on both functionality and aesthetics. Here's a breakdown of the design decisions and their rationale:<br>
<p>1. Homepage Design: The primary landing page incorporates images for both the driver and admin interfaces, elevating the visual appeal. These images not only make the site more engaging but also offer flexibility. They serve as placeholders, allowing for seamless integration of event information or other pertinent content in the future.<p/>
<p>2. Navigation System: Recognizing the importance of user-friendly navigation, a comprehensive navigation bar was integrated. It ensures users can intuitively find their way around the platform, enhancing overall user experience.<p/>
<p>3. Driver's Run Details: This route is backed by dual templates. The first presents a dropdown list for selections, while the second displays detailed driver run stats. The differentiation ensures that when users transition from the 'list driver' app route to access specific driver run details, they arenâ€™t confronted with the dropdown again, effectively reducing information clutter.
<p>4. Admin Interface: A specialized route was carved out exclusively for the admin interface. Itâ€™s an encapsulated space where administrators can tap into functionalities concealed from the general audience, ensuring secure administrative operations.<p/>
<p>5. Edit Runs Route: The 'edit runs' route uses one template for run selection and another for run detail modifications. The design ensures only the most pertinent fields are editable, thereby limiting potential human errors. To further bolster data integrity, input fields like time, cones, and wd are confined to numeric data types.<p/>
<p>6. Adding a Driver: The route to add a new driver streamlines information collection through a singular template. This consolidated approach reduces user navigation steps and ensures a smoother data entry experience. Alongside, robust input validation mechanisms are in place on both client and server sides to maintain data quality. <br><p/>
<p>7. Overall Results: I opted to include a caption below the table, providing explanations for the abbreviations. This was done to ensure that drivers who are newcomers to the event can easily comprehend the terms used. <p/>
In essence, each design decision was a balance between user-centric aesthetics and functional robustness, all while ensuring data integrity and usability remained paramount. <br>
<p>8. User feedback: Messages are displayed prominently to confirm that actions like updating data or adding a new driver have been completed successfully or unsuccessfully, providing users with immediate feedback on the success of their actions. </p>
