## Biosecurity Guide - Web Application Structure:
### Structure Overview:

**Blueprints and Their Roles:** <br>
- **Agronomist Blueprint:** Primarily caters to agronomists by providing access to view and possibly contribute to the pest/weed directory, alongside managing their professional profiles.<br>
- **Staff Blueprint:** Designed for staff users, focusing on the pest/weed directory (view, add, update, delete), uploading images for pest/weed entries, and managing their profiles. It enables staff to contribute to and maintain the pest/weed database. <br>
Agronomist Blueprint: Although not detailed in your submission, it's implied that this blueprint would cater to agronomists' specific functionalities, likely around viewing and possibly contributing to the pest/weed directory, along with managing their professional profiles. <br>
- **Admin Blueprint:** Handles routes and functionalities specific to the administrative role, including user management (add, edit, delete users), pest/weed directory management, and profile management. It serves as a central hub for system oversight and content management.<br>

**Functionality and Data Flow:**<br>
- **User Management:** Admins have the capability to manage user profiles across different roles, including creating new user accounts, editing existing ones, and removing users from the system. This involves interactions with the database to fetch, update, or delete user-related data.<br>
- **Pest/Weed Directory Management:** Both staff and admin roles can manage the pest/weed directory. This includes adding new entries, updating existing ones, uploading images, and deleting entries as needed. The process involves submitting forms, handling file uploads, and performing database transactions to maintain up-to-date and accurate directory information.<br>
- **Profile Management:** Users across all roles have the ability to view and edit their profiles, change their passwords, and log out. This personalization aspect ensures that users can maintain their account details and security settings as per their preferences.<br>

**Technical Considerations:**<br>
- **Session Management:** User sessions are utilized to manage login states and role-based access control. The session data dictate what resources and routes a user can access, ensuring a secure and personalized user experience.<br>

**Security and Access Control**<br>
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Decorators like @role_required enforce access control, ensuring that users can only access routes and functionalities pertinent to their assigned roles.<br>
- **Password Handling:** The hashing module is used for secure password management, involving hashing passwords before storing them in the database and verifying user login attempts.<br>
<p>This structure facilitates a modular and organized approach to developing and expanding the web application, with clear separation of role-based functionalities for admins, staff, and agronomists. <p/>

### Assumptions and design decisions: <br>
Throughout the development of the web application, several assumptions were made and design decisions were taken to guide the development process and address the requirements effectively. Below is a detailed account of these considerations.<br>
  **Assumptions:** <br>
- Profile Deletion Restrictions: Administrators and staff members do not have the capability to delete their own profiles to prevent accidental or malicious removal of essential users from the system. <br>
- Role Modification Limitations: Administrators are restricted from changing the roles of staff and agronomists post-creation. Their primary ability concerning user roles is to assign them appropriately at the time of new user creation. <br>
- Scalability and Customization: The web application is designed with future expansion in mind, allowing for the introduction of additional features and functionalities tailored to specific roles as the need arises.<br>
- User Registration Process: The platform mandates that all new user registrations occur directly through the website, ensuring a consistent and controlled entry point for user addition to the system. <br>
- Security: The application assumes a basic level of security for user authentication and authorization, primarily through session management and password hashing.

### Design decision: 
The website was crafted with an emphasis on both functionality and aesthetics. Here's a breakdown of the design decisions and their rationale:<br><br>
**Homepage Design**
- **Rationale**: The homepage was designed with visual appeal and functionality in mind, using engaging imagery to guide users towards their respective interfaces. This approach not only makes the site more inviting but also helps in conveying the purpose of the application intuitively.
- **Impact**: Enhanced user engagement from the first interaction, leading to a positive user experience. The distinct imagery for different user roles simplifies navigation, making it easier for users to find the information relevant to them.

**Navigation System**
- **Rationale**: Implementing a comprehensive and intuitive navigation system was crucial for enhancing usability. A well-structured navigation bar ensures users can easily access all parts of the application without confusion, significantly improving the overall user experience.
- **Impact**: Users benefit from a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, reducing frustration and increasing efficiency in completing tasks. The navigation system supports users in discovering all available features, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction.

**Role-Specific Templates**
- **Rationale**: Creating separate templates for different user roles (such as admin, staff, and agronomist) allows for a customized user experience that caters to the specific needs and permissions of each role. This design decision ensures that users only see content and options relevant to their responsibilities and access rights, enhancing security and usability.
- **Impact**: Improved clarity and efficiency for users by preventing information overload and reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities. Role-specific templates streamline the user journey within the application, leading to a more focused and productive experience.

**Modular Architecture Using Blueprints**
- **Rationale**: To enhance the application's scalability and maintainability by segregating functionalities based on user roles.
- **Impact**: Facilitated role-based access control and streamlined the development process by allowing independent development and testing of each module.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Rationale**: To ensure users can only access information and functionalities relevant to their roles, enhancing security and user experience.
- **Impact**: Implemented through decorators, RBAC prevents unauthorized access and simplifies navigation by presenting users with only the relevant options.

**Password Hashing for Security**
- **Rationale**: To secure user passwords against potential database breaches, ensuring that passwords are not stored in plain text.
- **Impact**: Increases user trust and application security. Utilizing Flask's `hashing` module provided an efficient way to implement this feature.

**Session Management for User State**
- **Rationale**: To maintain user state across requests, enabling personalized user experiences and security checks.
- **Impact**: Allowed seamless user experiences across different parts of the application while ensuring that users are authenticated and authorized for their actions.
